Hello everyone!

I'll give a short introduction about myself. My name is Mourish Antony. I am studying B.Tech in AI & DS at KGiSL Institute of Technology. I also work as a backend developer and AI engineer in the IPS Tech community.

This repository is for learning Python from basics to advanced topics, and we will also learn FastAPI.

FastAPI is a modern, high-performance Python web framework designed for building APIs. It leverages standard Python type hints to provide automatic data validation and serialization, and it generates interactive API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger UI).

## Day 1:
Today we are going to learn how to create a simple calculator that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Today we will learn about three programming concepts:

### 1. Variable Arithmetic Operators:
This concept contains operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

### 2. Sequence:
This concept involves the flow of the program - determining what should be printed and when.

**Example:**
If we want to print "Hello World", the code can be:
```python
print("Hello World")
```
or
```python
print("Hello")
print("World")
```

But we can't write:
```python
print("World")
print("Hello")
```
This demonstrates sequence - the order and flow of code execution.

### 3. Conditional Statements or Decision Making:
This concept contains if-else conditions for making choices in your program.
