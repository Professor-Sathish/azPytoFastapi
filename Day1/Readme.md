Hello everyone!

I'll give a short introduction about myself. My name is Mourish Antony. I am studying B.Tech in AI & DS at KGisl Institute of Technology. I also work as a backend developer and AI engineer in the IPS Tech community.

This repository is for learning Python from basics to advanced topics, and we will also learn FastAPI.

FastAPI is a modern, high-performance Python web framework designed for building APIs. It leverages standard Python type hints to provide automatic data validation and serialization, and it generates interactive API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger UI).

Day 1:
Today we are going to learn how to create a simple calculator that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Open `main.py` and run the code!
